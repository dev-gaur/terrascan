##### PRE-REQUISITE
1. Make sure you have required access on the kubernetes cluster to create and update the following resources:

  - Secrets
  - Configmaps
  - Deployments
  - Services
  - ValidatingWebhookConfiguration (only if you're aiming to deploy the webhook as well)

  If it is not a production level cluster, you probably do have the required access.

2. Make sure you have `kubectl`, `kustomize` and `openssh` installed on your local machine.

3. Make sure you replace `<TERRASCAN_NAMESPACE>` placeholder with your target namespace where you to want to deploy the
terrascan server. The string replacement will be required in the following files:

  - `server/kustomization.yaml`
  - `certs/domain.cnf` (that is generated in step 1 of `Generating TLS Certificates` section)
  - `webhook/kustomization.yaml` (only if you're aiming to deploy the webhook as well)
  - `webhook/validating-webhook.yaml` (only if you're aiming to deploy the webhook as well)

4. Generate SSH keys and copy `~/.ssh/config`, `~/.ssh/known-hosts` and `~/.ssh/<generated_private_key>` to `server/.ssh/` directory.
   replace `<SSH_KEY_NAME>` with your private ssh key's name in `server/kustomization.yaml` and setup the generated public ssh key on
   your respective code repository hosting service, like github or bitbucket.

   You may also use this shell command :

   Let's assume your private key is `~/.ssh/github_rsa`

  ```bash
  mkdir server/.ssh
  cp ~/.ssh/config ~/.ssh/known_hosts <pwd>/server/.ssh/
  cp ~/.ssh/github_rsa ~/.ssh/github_rsa.pub <pwd>/server/.ssh/
  sed s/<SSH_KEY_NAME>/github_rsa/g server/kustomization.yaml
  ```

#### Generating TLS Certificates

1. Create a domain.cnf file.

  ```bash
  mkdir server/certs
  touch server/certs/domain.cnf
  cat << EOF > certs/domain.cnf
  [req]
  default_bits = 2048
  prompt = no
  default_md = sha256
  x509_extensions = v3_req
  distinguished_name = dn
  [dn]
  C = <My_Country>
  ST = <My_State>
  L = <My_Location>
  O = <My_Organization>
  emailAddress = me@email.com
  CN = terrascan
  [v3_req]
  subjectAltName = @alt_names
  [alt_names]
  DNS.1 = terrascan-validating-hook.<TERRASCAN_NAMESPACE>.svc
  >EOF
  ```

  Note: Please replace the placeholders like `<My_Country>`, etc as per your requirements.

2. Generate `server.key` and `server.crt`.

  ```bash
  openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server/certs/server.key -out server/certs/server.crt -config server/certs/domain.cnf
  ```

### Deploying Terrascan Server

1. Generate your TLS certificate files and place them in the `server/certs/` directory as `server.key` and `server.crt`.
   Please refer to the `Generating TLS Certificates` section above.

2. Place your terrascan `config.toml` in the `server/config/` directory or edit the existing one.

3. In `server/deployment.yaml` Replace `<TERRASCAN_SERVER_KEY_PLACEHOLDER>` with the string that
   you want your terrascan server key to be.

   You may also use this shell command :

   Let's assume we want the string `t3rrascan` as the server key.

  ```bash
  sed s/<TERRASCAN_SERVER_KEY_PLACEHOLDER>/t3rrascan/g server/deployment.yaml
  ```

4. Deploy the terrascan server. Skip this step if you're aiming to setup terrascan webhook.

   Note: Before running the command, please verify once that the `server/kustomization.yaml` is set with the desired parameters.

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -k server/
  ```

### Setting Up Terrascan Webhook

1. Please follow steps 1 to 3 from the `Deploying Terrascan Server` section above.

2. In `webhook/validating-webhook.yaml` Replace `<TERRASCAN_SERVER_KEY_PLACEHOLDER>` with the string that
   you want your terrascan server key to be.

   You may also use this shell command :

   Let's assume we want the string `t3rrascan` as the server key.

  ```bash
  sed s/<TERRASCAN_SERVER_KEY_PLACEHOLDER>/t3rrascan/g webhook/validating-webhook.yaml
  ```

  Note: Please ensure that the terrascan key value you use here is same as used
  in Step 3 of `Deploying Terrascan Server` section.

3. In `webhook/validating-webhook.yaml`, replace `<CA_BUNDLE_PLACEHOLDER>` with the base64 encoded value of the
   `server/certs/server.crt` that was setup in Step 1 of `Deploying Terrascan Server` section.

   You may also use this shell command :

  ```bash
  $CA_BUNDLE=(cat server/certs/server.crt | base64)
  sed s/<CA_BUNDLE_PLACEHOLDER>/$CA_BUNDLE/g webhook/validating-webhook.yaml
  ```

4. In the `webhook/validating-webhook.yaml` file, set the `webhooks.rules` section as per your requirement. By default,
   we have setup a rule to block possibly all the resources from being created or updated. This might not be correct for
   your use case, refer the kubernetes admission webhook docs for the same.

   The following command might help as well.
  ```bash
  kubectl explain ValidatingWebhookConfiguration.webhooks.rules
  ```

5. Deploy.

   Note: Before running the command, please verify once that the `server/kustomization.yaml` & `webhook/kustomization.yaml`
         are set with the desired parameters.

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -k webhook/
  ```
